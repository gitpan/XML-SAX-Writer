    - on Solaris it would seem that iconv has problems converting an encoding
    to itself (at least, utf-8 to utf-8). Given that this is a useless 
    operation, it is now detected and replaced with a noop (thanks to
    David N. Blank-Edelman for reporting this).

0.02 - 0.36
    - many bugfixes thanks to many helpful people, notably Barrie Slaymaker, 
    Dave Rolsky, Sean M. Burke, and others.
