Revision history for XML::SAX::Writer:

0.38 wed 20020116 21:41:41
    - several major bugfixes that prevented some consumers (mostly Handle and
    File) from working at all.
    - the beginning of a test suite. It doesn't test the correctness of the
    XML that is created yet, but it does at least go through all the basic
    functions that are needed for that to work.

    - on Solaris it would seem that iconv has problems converting an encoding
    to itself (at least, utf-8 to utf-8). Given that this is a useless
    operation, it is now detected and replaced with a noop (thanks to
    David N. Blank-Edelman for reporting this).

0.02 - 0.36
    - many bugfixes thanks to many helpful people, notably Barrie Slaymaker,
    Dave Rolsky, Sean M. Burke, and others.
