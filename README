XML::SAX::Writer - SAX2 XML Writer

  use XML::SAX::Writer;
  use XML::SAX::SomeDriver;

  my $w = XML::SAX::Writer->new;
  my $d = XML::SAX::SomeDriver->new(Handler => $w);

  $d->parse('some options...');

This module is still considered alpha, though it has been put to
limited used. It will exit alpha stage once I'm done writing
a good test suite for it. It will exit beta stage once I have
added the formatting options.
