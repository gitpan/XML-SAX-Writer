XML::SAX::Writer - SAX2 XML Writer

  use XML::SAX::Writer;
  use XML::SAX::SomeDriver;

  my $w = XML::SAX::Writer->new;
  my $d = XML::SAX::SomeDriver->new(Handler => $w);

  $d->parse('some options...');

This module is still considered alpha. I haven't had time to write a good
test suite for it, and until that changes (hopefully soon) I will keep
considering it alpha status (and so should you ;).

Once that happens, I will start adding formatting options on the XML that it
produces.
